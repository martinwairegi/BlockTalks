# Block-Talks

Built with joy & love 

## How it works

- Hold down the spacebar to talk to Block-Talks. It's only listening while the key is being held down. 
- If you say right, left, down or up Block-Talks can move around the grid. 
- Say the name of any color and Block-Talks can change the grid blocks to that color! 
- You can also say hello and thanks. 

## Tips

- Try to speak clearly so that Block-Talks can understand you! Sometime speech recognition can be fickle.
- Don't be afraid to string commands together. Trying saying something like: "**Could you go right for me Block-Talks, then go down, go down again, go down one more time, take a left and change that block to pink for me?**"

## Demo

Unfortunately this requires a [speech recognition API capable browser](https://caniuse.com/#feat=speech-recognition), so basically it only works on Chrome right now ðŸ˜”
